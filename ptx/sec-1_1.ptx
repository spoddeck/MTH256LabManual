        <statement>
          <p>
            What is a function?  Find a formal definition of function (as a mathematical object), and then unpack that definition, explaining it in your own words.  Make sure to attend to the important details!

            <m>k(x)=f(x)+6</m>. So, we can shift the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> up <m>6</m> units to obtain <m>y=k(x)</m>.

            What is a solution to a differential equation?  Be specific.  Also explain why a solution is not the kind of algebraic solutions we’re used to (<m>x = 3</m>, for example) and why we need some of the mechanisms from problem 1 of this question.

            The growth of a population of fresh-water Gars in a large lake (where resources and space are effectively unlimited) can be modeled by the differential equation <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</me>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Unpack this equation in words.  What do all of the different letters mean?  What are their units?</p></li>
            <li><p>Classify the growth of the population for different values of <m>k</m>.  Attend to values of <m>k</m> less than zero, zero, between zero and one, and greater than one.</p></li>
            <li><p>If we allow fishing of the Gars at a constant rate, what does that do to our equation – what differential equation can we use to model this?</p></li>
            <li><p>If we allow fishing of the Gars at a rate proportional to the population, what differential equation can we use to model this?</p></li>
            <li><p>Assume that <m>N</m> is the maximum number of Gars that the lake can contain (the carrying capacity of the lake).  What differential equation can we use to model this?  (HINT: think about what happens when <m>P = N</m>, <m>P \gt N</m>, <m>P \lt N</m>).</p></li>
