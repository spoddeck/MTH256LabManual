      <title>Lab - Application - Newton’s Law of Cooling</title>
      <!--<introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the differential equation <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - 4</me>.

            I make a large pot of Peppermint Tea to serve to my Fancy Tea Party.  I make sure the water is at 90 degrees Celsius when I add it to the leaves, and then serve it to my Fancy guests after steeping for 30 minutes.  The room is the fanciest temperature, of course; 20 degrees Celsius.  When I finally finish my initial comments another 30 minutes after serving, I find that my tea has cooled to 40 degrees Celsius.  What was the temperature of the tea when I served it?

            <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.

            Do we need to use a differential equation for the problem above (a cooling problem using Newton’s Law of Cooling)?  Solve this problem algebraically – without using calculus.  Be clear about the assumptions you make!

        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>h(x)=-f(x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=h(x)</m>.
