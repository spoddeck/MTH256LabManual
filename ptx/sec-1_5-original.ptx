        <statement>
          <p>
            Lake Fidget is horribly polluted with agricultural run-off.  The lake contains 2600 cubic km of water, and has an inflow and outflow of 150 km<m>^3</m> per year.  In 2020 new legislation went into effect reducing the amount of agricultural pollution to zero, but it will take time to flush the current contaminants from Lake Fidget.  If <m>x(t)</m> is the amount of pollutant in tons per cubic km, And <m>x(0) = P</m>, write a differential equation that models the amount of pollutant in Lake Fidget, and find how long it takes for the pollution level to drop to half of 2020 levels.

            <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.

          <p>
            Given the pollution situation in Lake Fidget as above, now assume that the legislation reduces the agricultural to 10% of pre-2020 levels.  How long does it take under this situation for the pollution level to be halved?

            <m>h(x)=-f(x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=h(x)</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Early one morning it begins to snow at a constant rate.  At 7 am, a snowplow sets off to clear a road.  By 8am it had travelled 2 miles, but it took an additional 2 hours to go the next two hours.  Let <m>x(t)</m> be the distance travelled by the snow plow after <m>t</m> hours of travel, and <m>x(0) = 0</m> to make the math easier.  Also assume that the snowplow clears snow from the road at a constant rate (so goes slower as the snow gets deeper).  Perform the analysis to find the time at which it started snowing.

            During another snowstorm, the plow set off at 7 am as before.  This time it clears 4 miles by 8 am, and another 3 miles by 9 am.  What time did it start snowing under this scenario?
