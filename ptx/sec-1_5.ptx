        <p>
          Note: these are the same basic problems as the ones for <xref ref="sec-1_4"/>.  There we used numerical approximation techniques; here we will solve exactly. Once you find the solution compare with the answers you got from the last section!

        <statement>
          <p>
            A gold mining operation dumps its solvents in a holding pond.  The pond has an initial volume of <m>20,000</m> cubic meters of liquid, and each day a stream diverted into the pond delivers <m>1000</m> cubic meters of water.  Each day <m>1000</m> cubic meters of mixed waste water and solvents is pumped out for treatment.  However, solids carried in from the stream settle to the bottom of the pond, reducing its volume by <m>50</m> meters per day – so the pond will be full and need dredging after <m>400</m> days of operation.  Each day <m>5</m>kg of solvents enters the pond.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>x(t)</m> gives the amount of solvent in the pond (in kilograms) on day <m>t</m>, then the derivative <m>x’(t)</m> gives the rate of change of solvent in the pond, and can be found as follows:
            <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = rate_{in} - rate_{out}</me>.
            The rate in is constant, at <m>5</m> (kg/day).  The rate out varies as more solvent enters the pond.  Given that <m>1000</m> liters of water leave the pond each day, and the concentration of solids leaving the pond is the total amount of solvent in the pond on day <m>t</m>, divided by the total amount of water in the pond on day <m>t</m>, we can find the amount of solids that leave the pond by multiplying the amount of water (in liters) by the concentration (in kg/liter).
          </p>

            Use an integrating factor to solve for <m>x(t)</m> explicitly, and use that formula to find <m>x(10)</m> and <m>x(200)</m>.

        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            I retire, and between some good investments and selling my Portland home to move to Arizona, I have a nest egg of <m>\$2.5</m> million saved up, in an account that earns a guaranteed <m>3.5\%</m> annual interest for as long as I maintain a balance.  My tarot reader tells me that I have exactly <m>35</m> years to live after retirement before my death.  If I withdraw <m>\$120,000</m> per year, will there be any money left for my kids to inherit?  Remember that if <m>P(t)</m> is the amount I have in savings, let <m>P’</m> be the amount coming in (which is <m>0.035P</m>) minus the amount going out (which is <m>120,000</m>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Find the differential equation for <m>P’(t)</m>, solve it with an integrating factor for <m>P(t)</m>, and then find <m>P(35)</m> to answer the question here.
