      <title>Lab - Understanding Uniqueness and Existence</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Why and how does the formal definition of Uniqueness and Existence work?  I’m not asking for a formal proof here – what are the ideas behind the proof?  Why does the continuity of the differential function, and of the partial derivative with respect to <m>y</m>, mean the differential equation has one and only one solution for a given initial condition?  (Hint: Talk about continuity here.  If we have some function <m>f(x, y, y’)</m> that’s not continuous for some inputs, what does that mean?  Why could that give something that’s not unique, or that doesn’t exist?)

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>l(x)=3f(x)</m>. So, we can stretch the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> vertically by a factor of <m>3</m> to obtain <m>y=l(x)</m>.
