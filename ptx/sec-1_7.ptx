      <!--<introduction>
        <p>
          The growth of my population of Puffins (in hundreds of Puffins) can be modeled with the following: <me>P’ = P(P – 4) + k</me>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the differential equation <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + a</me>.  Sketch phase lines for different values of <m>a: a = -4, a = -1, a = 0, a = 1</m>.  What’s the bifurcation point for this differential equation?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>k(x)=f(x)+6</m>. So, we can shift the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> up <m>6</m> units to obtain <m>y=k(x)</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Given the ODE <me>x’ = 0.5x^2 + bx + 8</me>, find the two bifurcation points.  If we find these values as <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>, where <m>p &lt; q</m>, discuss the equilibria for <m>b &lt; p, b = p, p &lt; b &lt; q, b = q</m>, and <m>b &gt; q</m>.  By ‘discuss’ here we mean how many equilibria are there for given values of <m>b</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the ODE <me>y’ = (y-5)(11-y) - a</me>.  We could also write this as <me>y’ = -y^2 + 16y - 55 - a</me>.

          <ol>
            <li><p>Sketch a phase line for <m>a = 0</m>.  What are the equilibrium points here?</p></li>
            <li><p>Sketch phase lines for <m>a = 12, 10, 9, 8, 5, 0, -7, -27, -40, -55</m>, and <m>-72</m>.  It might be best to use technology, like Desmos, to help with this.  What is the bifurcation point here?</p></li>
            <li><p>Generate a bifurcation diagram: use <m>a</m> as the horizontal axis value, and <m>y</m> the vertical.  For the given values of <m>a</m> in part (b) above draw phase lines, with dots at the <m>y</m>-values that give equilibria over each different <m>a</m> value.</p></li>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Use the differential equation above, and assume that <m>y(t)</m> is the number of velociraptors in my theme park (in tens) during month <m>t</m>.  Also assume <m>a</m> is the number of velociraptors I harvest each month (so negative values indicate that I am purchasing more velociraptors to add to my herd).
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Assume I start with <m>40</m> velociraptors, and do no harvesting.  Do I expect my herd to grow, remain stable, or vanish over time?</p></li>
            <li><p>Answer the same question above, but starting with <m>0, 50, 75, 100</m>, and<m>120</m> velociraptors.</p></li>
            <li><p>Answer the same questions above, but now I harvest <m>50</m> velociraptors each month.</p></li>
            <li><p>What is the maximum number of velociraptors I can harvest each month, if I want to continue harvesting that amount indefinitely?  (Hint – this question is about the bifurcation point).  How does the initial number of velociraptors I have enter into this?</p></li>
          </ol>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.
