    <!--<introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the differential equation <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - 4</me>.

          Let’s consider Romeo and Juliet again, and look at their love equations through the lens of the Phase Plane.  For the three scenarios below (the same ones we analyzed in <xref ref="sec-3_2"/>) do the following:
          <ol marker="i">
            <li><p>Create the system of equations in matrix form and use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to find the solutions (we’ve done that in the previous section).</p></li>
            <li><p>Identify the straight-line solutions and discuss their relationship when the initial conditions fall on one of these solutions.</p></li>
            <li><p>What kind of equilibrium solution is <m>(0, 0)</m>?  Is it a sink, a source, or a saddle?</p></li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Juliet’s love changes by the amount of love she feels, and goes down by twice Romeo’s love; his love goes up by <m>4</m> times Juliet’s love, but down by <m>5</m> times his love for her.</p></li>
          <li><p>Juliet’s love increases by twice the amount of love she feels, but goes down the same amount of love Romeo feels for her; Romeo’s love goes down by <m>4</m> times the love she feels for him, but goes up by <m>5</m> times the amount of his love for her.</p></li>
          <li><p>Juliet’s love goes up by twice the amount of love she feels, and down by twice the amount of love Romeo feels for her; Romeo’s love goes down by five times the amount of love Juliet feels for him, and down by the same amount of love he feels for her.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.
        </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now consider our salty tanks problems from the previous section.  For each set of tanks identify the straight-line solutions, talk about what happens when our initial conditions start on one of these solutions, and identify the equilibrium point <m>(0, 0)</m> as a sink, source, or saddle.
        </p>
        <p>
          BONUS QUESTION: How long will it take to completely flush the tanks so that no salt remains in either?
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Tank A contains <m>1000</m> liters of brine, and tank B contains <m>1500</m> liters of brine.  <m>2000</m> liters per hour of fresh water pour into tank A, and <m>2000</m> liters per hour flow out of tank B.  Additionally, <m>3000</m> liters/hr flows from tank A to tank B, and <m>1000</m> liters/hr flows from B to A.</p></li>
          <li><p>Tanks A and B each contain <m>500</m> liters of brine.  <m>1000</m> liters per hour of fresh water pour into tank A, and <m>1000</m> liters per hour flow out of tank B.  Additionally, <m>1500</m> liters/hr flows from tank A to tank B, and <m>500</m> liters/hr flows from B to A.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>h(x)=-f(x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=h(x)</m>.
