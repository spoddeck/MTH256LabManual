            Consider the homogeneous 2nd-order Linear Differential Equation:
          </p>
          <p>
            <me>x'' + 5x’ + 6x = 0; x(0) = 2, x’(0) = -1</me>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Solve this equation using the techniques from this section.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Here are five matrices, each with the same eigenvalues <m>(-2, -3)</m> as the equation above.  Which one represents <m>x'' + 5x’ + 6x = 0</m> written as a system of two 1st-order differential equations?</p>
              <ol>
                <li><p><me>\begin{pmatrix}
                  -5 &amp; 3 \\

        <statement>
          <p>
            We’ve looked at converting a 2nd-order linear Differential equation into two 1st-order ODEs, by choosing a second variable to represent the derivative of our function and then solving for both variables as linear equations.  For example, the equation <m>x'' + 5x’ + 6x = 0</m>:
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <m>y = x’</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then <m>y’ = x''</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plugging <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> into our differential equation, we get <m>y’ + 5y + 6x = 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which we can solve for <m>y'</m> and get: <m>y’ = -6x - 5y</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So our system is now:
          </p>
          <p><md>
            <mrow>x’ \amp = y</mrow>
            <mrow>y’ \amp = -6x - 5y</mrow>
          </md></p>
          <p>
            Now let’s look at going the other way through:  Convert the system of linear 1st-order ODEs to a single 2nd-order ODE:
          </p>
          <p><md>
            <mrow>x’ \amp = ax + by</mrow>
            <mrow>y’ \amp = cx + dy</mrow>
          </md></p>
          <p>
            (HINT: since both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are themselves functions of <m>t</m>, start by taking the derivative of the top equation to get <m>x'' = ax’ + by’</m>.  Then use the two original equations to substitute in for <m>y</m> and <m>y’</m>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Convert the five matrices given in part 1b above to systems, and then use this technique to convert the system of 1st-order ODEs into a single 2nd-order ODE.
          </p>
          <p>
            NOTE: We generally try to convert things into linear algebra, so that computers can do the computations as quickly as possible; not so much the other way around like this.  It’s good practice to go back and forth by hand, though, to help us build intuition about how these things work.

        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>h(x)=-f(x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=h(x)</m>.
