        <statement>
          <p>
            A spring-mass system has mass <m>2</m> kg, frictional constant <m>10</m>, and spring constant <m>12</m> kg/s<m>^2</m>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Model this with a 2nd-order linear homogeneous ODE and solve for the position function.</p></li>
            <li><p>The spring is stretched to a length of <m>1</m> m from rest and then released.  Describe in words what happens over time, and then solve this IVP analytically.  What is the long-run behavior of this system, from your solution?</p></li>
            <li><p>Now we connect a motor to our system that provides a force <m>f(t) = 20 \sin(t)</m> to our system.  Describe in words what happens over time, and then solve this forcing IVP analytically.  What is the long-run behavior of this system from your solution?</p></li>
          </ol>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            A spring-mass system has mass 1 kg, no frictional forces, and a spring constant <m>k = 9</m> kg/s<m>^2</m>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Model this with a 2nd-order linear homogeneous ODE and solve for the position function.</p></li>
            <li><p>The spring is stretched to a length of <m>1</m> m from rest and then released.  Describe in words what happens over time, and then solve this IVP analytically.  What is the long-run behavior of this system, from your solution?</p></li>
            <li><p>The laboratory in which we are analyzing this spring-mass system is on a research boat, and the motion of the waves provides a force <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m> to our system.  Describe in words what happens over time, and then solve this forcing IVP analytically.  What is the long-run behavior of this system, from your solution?</p></li>
            <li><p>The next day the motion of the waves provides a force <m>f(t) = \cos(3t)</m> to our system.  Describe in words what happens over time, and then solve this forcing IVP analytically, if possible.  What is the long-run behavior of this system?  (We will look more closely at situations like this in the <xref ref="sec-4_4"/> on <em>resonance</em>.)</p></li>
