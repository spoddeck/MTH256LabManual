          <ol>
            <li><p>Using a CAS, graph the slope field for the ODE, and highlight the IVP solution curve.</p></li>
            <li><p>Using a technique from chapter 2, solve the IVP above.</p></li>

            Now, consider the following Spring-Mass system modeled with the 2nd order Linear ODE: <me>x'' + 4x  = \sin(3t),   x(0) = x’(0) = 0</me>

            <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            A spring-mass system is modeled with the 2nd order Liner ODE:
            <me>x'' + 5x’ + 6x = 0;     x(0) = 5; x’(0) = 0</me>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Unpack that equation – describe in words the forces being summed here, and what the initial condition represents.  Without solving or graphing, what do you expect this system to do, long-term?</p></li>
            <li><p>Use a CAS to graph <m>x(t).</m>  What is the long-term behavior, from your graph?</p></li>
            <li><p>Solve the system.  Use either a Laplace argument, or a characteristic polynomial argument.  If we let <m>t</m> go to infinity, what happens?</p></li>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            To the above spring-mass system, we attach a mechanism that adds the forcing function <m>f(t) = \cos(t),</m> so our new ODE is:
            <me>x'' + 5x’ + 6x = \cos(t);     x(0) = 5; x’(0) = 0</me>
          </p>

            <li><p>Unpack that equation – describe in words the forces being summed here, and what the initial condition represents.  Without solving or graphing, what do you expect this system to do, long-term?</p></li>

        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>g(x)=f(-x)</m>. So, we can reflect the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis to obtain <m>y=g(x)</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            We change the situation above – the forcing function is now intermittent, and only acts on the system over the interval <m>t \geq 5.</m>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Thinking about our spring-mass system with this force added, do we expect the short-run behavior to be different?  What about the long-term behavior?</p></li>
            <li><p>Solve this system without a Laplace method.  We’ll need to have two different solutions – before and after the force acts – and different initial conditions for each.</p></li>
            <li><p>Solve this system using a Laplace method.</p></li>
            <li><p>Does it matter if the endpoint is included?  Thinking about the system, what changes would you expect if the force acted over the interval <m>t \gt 5</m> instead?</p></li>
          </ol>

        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>k(x)=f(x)+6</m>. So, we can shift the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> up <m>6</m> units to obtain <m>y=k(x)</m>.

            One more change – same spring-mass system we’ve been looking at,
            <me>x'' + 5x’ + 6x = f(t), x(0) = 5, x’(0) = 0.</me>
            Now, however, we apply the force <m>f(t) = \cos(t)</m> over the interval <m>5 \lt t \lt 10.</m>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Thinking about our spring-mass system with this force added, what do we expect our long-term behavior to be?</p></li>
            <li><p>Solve this system without a Laplace method.  We’ll need to have three different solutions – before, during, and after the force acts – and different initial conditions for each.</p></li>
            <li><p>Solve this system using a Laplace method.</p></li>
