          <em>Calculus</em> means <q>a method of calculation or reasoning.</q>
          When one computes the sales tax on a purchase,
          one employs a simple calculus.
          When one finds the area of a polygonal shape by breaking it up into a set of triangles,
          one is using another calculus.
          Proving a theorem in geometry employs yet another calculus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the wonderful advances in mathematics that had taken place into the first half of the 17th century,
          mathematicians and scientists were keenly aware of what they <em>could not do.</em>
          (This is true even today.) In particular,
          two important concepts eluded mastery by the great thinkers of that time:
          area and rates of change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Area seems innocuous enough;
          areas of circles, rectangles, parallelograms,
          etc., are standard topics of study for students today just as they were then.
          However, the areas of <em>arbitrary</em>
          shapes could not be computed,
          even if the boundary of the shape could be described exactly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rates of change were also important.
          When an object moves at a constant rate of change,
          then <q><m>\text{distance} = \text{rate}\times\text{time}</m>.</q>
          But what if the rate is not constant<mdash />can distance still be computed?
          Or, if distance is known, can we discover the rate of change?
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out that these two concepts were related.
          Two mathematicians, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz,
          are credited with independently formulating a system of computing that solved the above problems and showed how they were connected.
          Their system of reasoning was <q>a</q> calculus.
          However, as the power and importance of their discovery took hold,
          it became known to many as <q>the</q> calculus.
          Today, we generally shorten this to discuss <q>calculus.</q>
